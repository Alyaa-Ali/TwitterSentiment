To run the app, you'll need to have flask available in your environment. 

I'd suggest making a new virtualenv and running 

`pip install flask`

If you then navigate to the folder containing app.py, you can run

`flask run`

To run the site locally

Other dependencies for the data analysis can be installed from the requirements.txt file
