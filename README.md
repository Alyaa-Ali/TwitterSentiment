# Flask-Dash
A short example showing how Flask could be used as a backend web server for the Twitter application.

To run the app, you'll need to have flask available in your environment. 

I'd suggest making a new virtualenv and running 

`pip install flask`

If you then navigate to the folder containing app.py, you can run

`flask run`

To run the site locally
